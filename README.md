# How to play (Using VSCode)
To run this Ruby program in VSCode, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Open your Ruby file in VSCode. You can create a new file by selecting "File" > "New File" and then saving it with a `.rb` extension.

2. Install the Ruby extension for VSCode if you haven't already. You can do this by opening the Extensions panel on the left-hand side of the editor, searching for "Ruby", and then installing the extension.

3. Make sure that Ruby is installed on your computer. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the (official Ruby website)[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/]

4. Once you have Ruby installed, you can run your program from the terminal. To do this, open a new terminal window in VSCode by selecting "Terminal" > "New Terminal" from the top menu bar.

5. In the terminal you opened inside of you connect-four forked repository, run the program using the `ruby` command followed by the name of your file.

```
ruby four.rb
```

6. Your program should now run and prompt you to select the column for your first move. You will alternate between yourself, and another player of your choosing!
